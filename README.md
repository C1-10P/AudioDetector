## Work in Progress

## Forked from BabyMonitor
This Project is based on the great
work from Damian Nowok (0x1001) https://github.com/0x1001/BabyMonitor.

### Why forked?

I had problems with the audio recording, so I heavily debugged
the code, added some debug code, and did some refactoring.
I also added a watchdog system. It restarts the recording
process in case it is crashed. In this progress I changed a 
lot of code. I broke with the original application design, so
it is dificult to contribute my changes back to the orignial project.
Maybe my modifications are useful for somebody. I want to to share my 
modifications with the community. So I decided to start a little fork.
